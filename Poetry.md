# Maths and Physics Poetry

## Calculus

<pre>
In pre-calculus for proof by induction
you don't need to be good will hunting
don’t forget to state your assumption
or you might lose marks,
if it's not clear where you start,
follow the steps and make a deduction

Next you'll be introduced to functions and their properties
whether it's exponential or trigonometry
in much more detail than a glossary
ending with the complex plane,
until it's stuck in your brain,
and you have a good grasp of the majority

Then you'll be starting limits
hopefully in high spirits
the formal definition may be explicit
in terms of epsilon and delta infinitesimals,
but the applications are plentiful,
it will be clear by the time that you finish

As you begin to take derivatives and fight off integrals
whether its feels hard or trivial
in mathematics it's typical
it’s nothing mysterious or strange,
you’ll see how it's connected to the rate of change,
and the area within an interval

Lastly you'll cover the power series expansion
related to Taylors theorem and Maclaurin
in an infinite sum the remainder you abandon
excluding the points for which function is divergent,
domain of the expansion given by the radius of convergence,
which will make more sense once you see it in action.

## ★ Stars ★

<pre>
Stars afar reveal the past,
Photons that leave the surface from the start,
Bosons with no mass on a geodesic path,
Motion red-shifted travel vastly fast.

Dead stars colliding leave ripples through gravity,
Waves arising from the interaction savagely,
Emphasizing general relativity naturally,
Symbolizing beauty of the universe mechanically.

## Dynamical (super)symmetry enhancement

<pre>
How do we study black holes when it's hard to envisage,
We try to create models with the quantum gravity spirit,
A 2d surface like a holographic image,
Zoom in right at the boundary taking the near horizon limit,

Retaining the geometric structure when your quite close,
To an outside observer it will look like your time froze,
With regular coordinates we adapt a frame to the light cone,
Writing everything in terms the basis in the right zone,

Local supersymmetry to reduce the problem,
Solving the spinor and stating the conditions on them,
Without higher derivative terms and no quantum,
Global analysis to derive properties from them

Lichnerowicz theorem to modify the Dirac equation,
With free parameters that might be ranging,
Show the zero modes and the Killing spinors are the same thing,
Using the maximum principle or partially integrating,

Dynamical supersymmetry enhancement
The symmetry algebra also undergoes enlargement,
Index and Killing vectors to find the answers,
Analyse the geometry from the conditions to unmask them.
</pre>


## Physical

<pre>
Einstein merked it when he said light was constant,
No body heard it they dismissed it as nonsense,
Maxwell's equations describe electromagnetism,
Light was constant there Newton's equation had some flaw in em,
In the Newtonian viewpoint time is absolute,
Turned out it was wrong but therein lies the truth,
Time is relative for every intertial frame of reference,
You might leave through the door but to me its still the entrance,
The faster you go the more time slows down,
Physical principles make the world go round,
Energy and mass turned out to be one in the same,
Starlight bent by the mass of the sun puts Newton to shame,
An increase in speed just makes you get more heavier,
Heavy bodys bend spacetime in a finite area,
At the speed of light your mass would increase to infinity,
Appreciate the facts dont ever try to limit me,
Faster than light makes you travel to the past,
Make you want to sit back again in your class,
Impossible by the continous nature of velocity,
Man will never give up as you can see historically.
