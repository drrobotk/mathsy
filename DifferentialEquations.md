# Differential Equations

A **differential equation** is one which involves derivatives of unknown functions of various order, as well as the independent variables. The two main types are ordinary and partial differential equations, denoted as ODE or PDEs, which can come in various flavours.

Such equations have a remarkable ability to predict the world around us and are used in various real world applications in a number of different fields. Most things in life are dynamical and changing, thus a mathematical description of them will relate derivatives of some function, since these are the *'rate of change'*.

One example is in *biology* with modelling cancer growth or disease.

Models of tumor growth and treatment based on a small number of ODEs have a very long history, dating back to the equation of expontential growth,

where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=N(t)"> is the number of clonogenic cells in a tumor at time <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=t">. In more general models, we replace the RHS with a generic function <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f(N)"> with the appropriate parameters and properties.

A similar equation can be used as a simple model for population growth known as *Malthusian's Law* where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=N(t)"> would be replaced by <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=P(t)">, the population at time <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=t">.
