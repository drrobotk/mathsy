# Spacetime and Special Relativity

The idea to treat time as a fourth dimension first arose in science fiction with 'The Time Machine' by H G Wells published in 1895. It only entered the science arena 10 years later when Einstein published his paper on Special relativity in 1905, revealing a fundemental link between space and time.

In physics, spacetime is a concept that fuses 3 dimensions of space and 1 dimension of time into a single 4-dimensional continuum <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(x,y,z,t)">. 

Special relativity is based on the idea that the laws of physics donâ€™t change, even for objects moving in inertial frames of reference and that the speed of light is the same for all observers, regardless of their motion relative to the light source.

Due to the principles of special relativity, it is known that two observers cannot agree on whether two events in spacetime happened at the exact same time due to *time dilation*.

| *The idea of simultaneity breaks down in special relativity.* |

This idea is best captured with the thought experiment where a stationary observer witnesses two lightning bolts striking the ends of the train at the same time, while the observer on the train would see the them happening at different times.
